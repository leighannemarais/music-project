            <h5>Why Ed Sheeran</h5>
            <h2>Why is Ed Sheeran the best?</h2>
            <p>
              Sheeran's musical style has been described as pop, folk-pop, and
              soft rock. He also incorporates rap into his music. Sheeran has
              sold more than 150 million records worldwide, making him one of
              the world's best-selling music artists. He has 101 million
              RIAA-certified units in the US, and two of his albums are in the
              list of the best-selling albums in UK chart history. In December
              2019, the Official Charts Company named him artist of the decade,
              with the most combined success in the UK album and singles charts
              in the 2010s. As of April 2022, he is the most followed artist on
              Spotify. Beginning in March 2017, his รท Tour became the
              highest-grossing of all time in August 2019.
            </p>
            <p>
              One of the most amazing things about Ed, is that he really is an
              amazing musician. Every single sound created, is one done by him
              with his feet and a loop pedal. Just give Ed a guitar and a loop
              pedal and he will be able to make his songs sound amazing. The
              set-up process with the looping is so methodical and it is amazing
              to watch at his concerts.
